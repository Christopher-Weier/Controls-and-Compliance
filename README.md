## 📜 Compliance Assessment Checklist  

The organization was also evaluated against several **regulatory and compliance best practices** to determine adherence and identify gaps.

---

### 💳 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

Best practices reviewed:
- Only authorized users have access to customers’ credit card information  
- Credit card data is stored, processed, and transmitted in a secure environment  
- Data encryption is used to protect credit card transactions  
- Secure password management policies are adopted  

---

### 🌍 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Best practices reviewed:
- E.U. customer data is kept private and secured  
- A breach notification plan exists to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours  
- Data is properly classified and inventoried  
- Privacy policies and procedures are enforced and documented  

---

### 🏢 System and Organization Controls (SOC 1 & SOC 2)

Best practices reviewed:
- User access policies are established  
- Sensitive data (PII/SPII) is treated as confidential  
- Data integrity ensures accuracy, consistency, and validation  
- Data availability is restricted to authorized individuals.

---

## ⚠️ Risk Implications  
The assessment identified multiple control and compliance gaps that could increase organizational risk, including:
- Overly broad user access  
- Lack of disaster recovery planning  
- Insufficient monitoring and detection capabilities  
- Weak data protection mechanisms  

If left unaddressed, these gaps could lead to:
- Data breaches  
- Regulatory penalties  
- Operational downtime  
- Loss of customer trust

## 🛠️ Recommendations  

Based on the assessment, the following recommendations were provided to improve Botium Toys’ security posture and reduce risk:

1. Establish proper **separation of duties** to prevent conflicts of interest  
2. Enforce the **principle of least privilege** for all system and data access  
3. Develop and implement **disaster recovery plans**  
4. Establish **regular backups** for all critical systems and data  
5. Update **password policies** to meet industry standards  
6. Acquire and deploy an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**  
7. Implement **encryption** for data at rest and in transit  
8. Deploy a **password management system**  
9. Formalize **user access policies**  
10. Ensure all **PII/SPII** is stored and transmitted securely  
11. Perform **more frequent audits** until compliance gaps are resolved, then return to a standard audit schedule.
